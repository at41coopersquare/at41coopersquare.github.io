			<p>
Instead of using ductwork to circulate air and regulate temperature of classrooms and laboratories, radiant panels pass temperature regulated water through pipes to heat and cool the building.
<br><br>
In the winter, the pumps circulate hot water supplied by the boiler through radiant heating coils located above the ceiling of each floor. In the summer, valves connect the chiller to the radiant panels, allowing for cool water to pump through radiant coils and cool spaces.
<br><br>
Using radiant panels is more energy efficient than traditional HVAC systems because water was a much higher heat capacity than air. Therefore, less energy is needed to change the temperature of the water than of traditional air systems. Additionally, the piping system uses pumps to circulate the fluid which uses less energy than the fans used to circulate air through ductwork.
<br><br>
Radiant panels also allow 41CS to save headroom space in the building since coils take up lesss volume than ductwork and there are no uncomfortable fdrafts since air is not being blown throughout the building.
