			<h5>How are the spaces in 41CS cooled?</h5>
			<p>
Typically, spaces are cooled using two 500 ton chillers. Combined, these chillers have the same cooling capacity as 600 window A.C. units.
<br><br>
Cooling of certain spaces of 41CS is still needed during the winter months. Spaces with high occupancy ratings or high power usage such as the computer center must be cooled even during the cold season. In these cases, water side free cooling is used.
<br></p>
<h5>How is water side free cooling energy efficient?</h5>
<p>To reduce energy costs and avoid using chillers during the winter, 41CS uses water side free cooling when cooling needs are low. Water side free cooling utilizes the already cool water from the cooling towers located on the roof of the building and uses two heat exchangers in lieu of the two 500 ton chillers which reduces energy costs.
	<h5>How does water side free cooling work?</h5>
	<p>First, naturally cold water from the cooling tower located on the roof of 41CS pass through the free cooling heat exchanger (HX).
		<br><br>
		Next, the free cooling HX allows for the primary supply water to be cooled by the water from the cooling tower. The secondary HX uses the now cold primary water supply to cool the secondary water supply.
		<br><br>
		To cool spaces, the secondary water supply passes through the radiant coils located throughout the building.
