41CS hosts a variety of spaces with different ventilation needs, from the cafeteria to classrooms, and from labspaces to offices. Because of the wide variety of rooms in the building, the ventilation needs thorughout the building are extensive and complex.
<br><br>
The grand staircase at 41CS creates a large central atrium from the ground floor to the 4th floor and is continued throughout the building by using separate smaller staircases between the 5th and 9th floors. The open space running up the center of the building ventilates indoor space naturally so air-handling units (AHU's) can recycle treated air cheaply and efficiently. 
<br><br>
While the atrium allows for efficient ventilation of air, all classrooms and offices are provided with 100% outside air (studies show fresh air maximizes productivity!). The atrium and AHU's then recirculate this air to other spaces throughout the building. On the other hand, air from labs must be completely exhausted to elimiante the potential for chemical contamination. As for their air intake, lab spaces use a portion of fresh air mixed with recycled air.
