			<h5>Why do we have a green roof?</h5>
			<p>Average temperatures of cities are naturally 4-5 degrees hotter than suburban and rural areas because pavement absorbs more heat than soil. This is known as the heat island effect.Adding gardens to the roofs of buildings decreases the heat island effect and decreases the temperature of the city. 41CS hosts a green roof above the 9th floor. 
<br><br>
Green roofs also reduce storm water runoff. Since soil absorbs rainwater during storms, less water is rushing toward the the sewer system which decreases the flooding effect on the sidewalks and streets during storms.<br></p>
			<h5>How is the green roof related to research at The Cooper Union?</h5>
			<p>Currently, the Center for Innovation and Applied Technology (CIAT) led by Professor Dell of the Mechanical Engineering department is researching ways to improve the efficiency of the green roof. NYC law states that water used to heat buildings must be cooled to 65.6&deg;C before being dumped into the sewage system. Most building systems cool this old heated water by mixing it with cool drinking water, wasting usable filtered water. The CIAT proposes passing heated water through pipes located below the green roof gardens in order to naturally cool the water to allowed temperatures for sewage disposal. It is expected that NYC will save $9.8 million in water and sewage costs using this method.
